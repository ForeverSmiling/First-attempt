This is a simple Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
I wrote it to try python after watching Google's Python Class and solving a little of problems on http://projecteuler.net/

Arrows/Mouse - Move white cloud
Space/Mouse_click - Place/delete black cloud
Return - Start simulation
